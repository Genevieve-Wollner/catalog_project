#Item Catalog Project

### About this Project:

The Item Catalog Project is one of the harder projects I've done in my Udacity courses. It was a challenge to put together this web application, but I think it was really helpful! This project was intended to practice my understanding of CRUD operations, and implement them in a functioning web application.

- Vagrant (make this a link to the vagrant install instructions)

### How To Run:

- download the project (provide link to github repo include the vagrant file in my repo)
